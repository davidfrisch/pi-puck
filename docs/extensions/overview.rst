Extensions Overview
===================

The Pi-puck has two main interfaces for extensions -- the 20-pin multi-interface auxiliary connector (X1), and the six 4-pin I2C sensor connectors (SC1-SC6). This section documents various available extensions using those interfaces.


:ref:`YRL Expansion Board`
--------------------------

A multi-feature expansion board for the Pi-puck, developed by York Robotics Lab, that connects to SPI, I2C and USB buses through the auxiliary interface.


:ref:`Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor`
-------------------------------------

A small VL53L1X-based distance sensor add-on for the six sensor board sockets on the Pi-puck.
