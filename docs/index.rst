Pi-puck
=======

| **A Raspberry Pi interface for the e-puck robot platform.**
| Developed jointly by the `York Robotics Laboratory (YRL)`_ at the `University of York`_, and `GCtronic`_.


The Pi-puck is an extension for the `e-puck`_ and `e-puck2`_, allowing a `Raspberry Pi Zero W`_ [#]_ to be mounted on the robot, adding Linux support, additional peripherals, and further expansion possibilities.

Documentation on this website is currently a work in progress.
