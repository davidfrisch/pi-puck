About the Pi-puck
=================

The Pi-puck is an extension for the `e-puck`_ and `e-puck2`_ robot platforms, allowing a `Raspberry Pi Zero W`_ [#]_ to be mounted on the robot, adding Linux support, additional peripherals, and further expansion possibilities.

It was developed as a joint project between the `York Robotics Laboratory (YRL)`_ at the `University of York`_, and `GCtronic`_.



.. [#] Also compatible with Raspberry Pi Zero WH (with headers included), Raspberry Pi Zero (without built-in wireless), or potentially other Raspberry Pi compatible boards.
